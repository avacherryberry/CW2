            <h3>Jabberwocky</h3>
            <h4>By Lewis Carroll</h4>
            <pre>
    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
            <em>
    <strong>"Beware the <span>Jabberwock</span>, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</strong>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
<strong>The frumious Bandersnatch!"</strong>
            </em>
    He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought.
